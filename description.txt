[h1]Changes and Additions[/h1]
[list]
[*] Disable ESAP hybrid paths as they overlap with Evolved.
[*] Added restrictions for ecologist/industrialist APs, allow authoritarian/liberal APs for elitist/egalitarians.
[*] Add small buffs from Evolved to equivalent ESAP APs and fixed one of the goverment APs buffing the wrong economic category.
[*] Nerfed the materialist AP, too much unity.
[*] Allow some of the APs to work with equivalent authorities (megacorp, patricorp, ai corp / hive, cyber hive, bio hive).

For the suggested triggers and points to hook some of these changes allowing me to make this without having to overwrite too much.
